<p>
In the article "Perceived Peer and Teacher Goals: Relationships with Students’ Academic Achievement Goals" the article makes several references to the correlations between the environment that students are placed in and how they affect the overall quality of the goals. I agree and believe that the current environment I am in as a business student does affect the quality of my goals. To know that people in my program were able to do things that I aim to do, the stature of my goals increase as I am more likely to be able to accomplish them.

An aspect of the article that I agree with is the concept of the Mastery Approach. This approach entails learning through making mistakes. Based upon my goals, it is imminent that I make mistakes in order to learn from my mistakes and formulate my experiences. This directly relates to my goal of being in a managerial position and being able to lead and hold people managment skills.

The last finding in this article that resonated with my goals in 5 years pertains to how the peer environment affects the motivation of our goals and that even when mistakes are made, the peer environment affect the perceived goals. A positive response from peers in regards to mistakes and learning allows one to perceive that their goals are attainable
